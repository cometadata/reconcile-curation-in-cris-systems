# Reconcile curation of DOI metadata in CRIS systems

This is a COMET enrichment and curation workflow pilot project. Go to the [Pilot Projects Overview Board](https://github.com/orgs/cometadata/projects/14) to see all of the pilots.  

## Objective

Leverage data from institutional Current Research Information Systems (CRIS) to enhance metadata, primarily by identifying institutional works and improving the accuracy and completeness of affiliation metadata through ROR ID assignment.

## Getting Involved 

COMET is in the process of setting up a Github space for ideas and feedback from the COMET community. In the meantime, get involved by: 
* providing input on the project at [the pilot project epic](https://github.com/cometadata/reconcile-curation-in-cris-systems/issues/4)
